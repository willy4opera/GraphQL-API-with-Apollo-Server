# GraphQL API Implementation Plan

## Objective
Develop a GraphQL API that demonstrates query optimization, schema design, and resolver implementation using Apollo Server.

## Requirements

- Design GraphQL schema with types and resolvers
- Implement queries and mutations
- Add input validation
- Implement data loading optimization
- Add GraphQL Playground/Studio integration

## Expected Deliverables

- Working GraphQL API
- Schema definition files
- Resolver implementations
- Query examples and documentation

## Implementation Plan

1. **Setup Project**
   - Initialize the project directory.
   - Install `@apollo/server` and `graphql`.

2. **Design Schema**
   - Define GraphQL types in schema files.
   - Include fields for queries and mutations.

3. **Implement Resolvers**
   - Write resolvers for each query and mutation.
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging.

4. **Implement Queries and Mutations**
   - Implement basic queries for fetching data.
   - Implement mutations for data modification.

5. **Add Input Validation**
   - Integrate validation logic within resolvers.
   - Use libraries like `Joi` or `yup` for input validation.

6. **Optimize Data Loading**
   - Use DataLoader for batching and caching.
   - Optimize resolver functions for performance.

7. **Integrate GraphQL Playground/Studio**
   - Enable GraphQL Playground/Studio for development.
   - Secure access in production environments.

8. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Write test cases for queries and mutations.
   - Document schema and usage examples.
